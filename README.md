Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of developing solutions for problems in real-world using computer technology

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering - this marked a shift in programming to a more structured approach 
Agile Methodologies - it a advocated for a more flexible and iterative approach to software
The rise of DevOps - it promoted a culture of collaboration between development and operation team to improve software
delivery and reliability


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design - development of a detailed blueprint of the system based on the requirments
Developmemt - process of writing code according to the design specification
Testing - ensuring the software meets the intended quality and standard
Deploymrnt - release the software and make it operational
Maintenance - address any issues that arise after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile - iterativeand incremental this ensure that a is completed and reviewed before moving to the next task
Waterfall - linear and sequential
Agile is flexible while waterfall is difficult to accomodate change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writing code and implementing software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensuring software quality by designing and executing tests
Project Manager - oversee planning, ececution and delivery of software


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - provide comprehensive tools for writting debugging and testing code
VCS - tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing in requirement 
Tight deadline
Technical debt
This challanges can be overcome by effective communication, priortizing tasks and regular reassesment.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components of the software
Intergrated testing - testing the interaction between different components and sub-systems in a software
System testing - testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing - this is to ensure the software meets the users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering - is crafting the right instructions to get the best response or answer from an AI.
Its ensures a efficient, accurate and quick response if the input is right.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example: Siri give me direction to the market.
Siri give me direction to Mtindwa market.
