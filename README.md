Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Application of engineering principles and tools to develop solutions for real world problems using
computer technology

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is important because it ensure development of reliable,efficient software solution
which is important in mordern business operations.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Waterfall- it follows a linear and sequential manner this ensure that each phase must be completed
before the next begins
b)Agile- iterative and incremental this see that ever is reviewed before moving forward
c)Advent- highlights on a more collaborative process between developers and operation 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning - involve defining the project and its objectives
b) Requirment analysis- involves gathering documents and detailed requirments needed for the software
c) Design -creating a blueprint for the software system
d) Development- writing code for the software
e) Testing -ensure the software work as intended
f) Deployment- releasing the software 
g) Maintainance -update


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile requires regular feedback with my result to a different product than initiatly intended while waterfall can only accomodate feedback at the end of the project make it difficult to accomodate change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software daveloper- write code and implement software solution
b) Quality assurance engineer- ensure software quality and execute test
c) Project manager- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code while VCS enables to track change in source code 
and cordinate team members.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Time constraint 
b) Security concerns  
c) team coordination
# Most of the challanges face by software engineers can be overcome by effective project management and good communication
among the team members


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing - involves testing individual components of the software
b) Intergration testing - interaction between different components or sub-systems
c) System testing - testing the entire system as a whole
d) Acceptance testing - to ensure the software the user needs and intended purpose

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 It is the action of giving a set of instruction to an AI model with the intention of getting an output
 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example; Give me directions to the market 
         Give me directions to mtindwa market
the second prompt is more effective because it is clear about which market the directions are required for
